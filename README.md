# Flutter Test

You will need to create one Flutter project with the following instruction. Please make sure to read the instruction carefully.

## Prerequisites

- An API key from [Polygon.io](https://polygon.io)

## Scenario

- Please create one Android App using Flutter framework for cryptocurrency market watch list. You can clone this repo and start from there.

- Provide the resulting .apk file, or
- If you decide to use cloud solution to host you application, make sure that it can still be accessed for the period of two weeks

## Assessment aspects

- Real time aspect of the price change
- Application speed and stability
- Code cleanliness
- Abstraction layer
- Unit test and functional API test

## Information

The documentation for the API is [here](https://polygon.io/docs/crypto/getting-started)
